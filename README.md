# Titanic-Model-Dataset For Beginners to learn the basics of Machine Learning.

This is a tutorial in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster.
The goal of this repository is to provide an example of a competitive analysis for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions.

You can access my kernal on kaggle here [Titanic Competition Kernal](https://www.kaggle.com/vjgupta/titanic-simple-model-beginners)

**Your goal is to predict survival on Titanic and get familiar with ML basics**
